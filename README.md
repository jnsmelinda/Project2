As the result of the second group project of the bootcamp we came up with the idea of VENT. It is an interactive website to help concerned citizens to see what is the air in their area and to provide a platform where they are able to express their feelings  and submit a short message to their local representative regarding the air quality.

We utilized the [AirNOW.gov](https://www.airnow.gov/?city=Bellevue&state=WA&country=USA), [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) and [OpenCage geocoding](https://opencagedata.com/api) APIs to pull and display air quality data and the [Civic Info](https://developers.google.com/civic-information) API to get the local representative based on the query location.

## Installation
At first, you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then you need to install the required modules by running `npm install` in the command-line and start your mySQL database. You also need to add a `.env` file to the root folder add your own api keys like this: 

`API_KEY_GEOCODE={your API key goes here}`
`API_KEY_AIRNOW={your API key goes here}`

Resources:
[AirNOW.gov](https://www.airnow.gov/), [OpenCage geocoding](https://opencagedata.com/)
